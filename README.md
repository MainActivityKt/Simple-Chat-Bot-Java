## Stage 1/5: Meet the chat bot
In this stage, the name and the creation date of the chat 
bot is printed to the console.
Run [SimpleBot.java](src/main/java/bot/SimpleBot.java), or [Main.java](src/main/java/org/) and input `1`.

Example

    Hello! My name is Aid.
    I was created in 2023.

## Stage 2/5: Introduce yourself
Extending the previous stage by adding a greet feature to the bot.
Run [FriendlyBot.java](src/main/java/bot/FriendlyBot.java), or [Main.java](src/main/java/org/) and input `2`.

Example

    Hello! My name is Aid.
    I was created in 2023.
    Please, remind me your name.
    > Amina
    What a great name you have, Amina!

## Stage 3/5: Let the chat bot guess your age
In this stage, the bot gets smarter and finds out someone's age by using
the popoular formula, getting the remainder of their age divided by 3, 5, and 7.

Run [SmartBot.java](src/main/java/bot/SmartBot.java) or [Main.java](src/main/java/org/) and input `3`.

Example

    Hello! My name is Aid.
    I was created in 2023.
    Please, remind me your name.
    What a great name you have, Max!
    Let me guess your age.
    Enter remainders of dividing your age by 3, 5 and 7.
    Your age is {yourAge}; that's a good time to start programming!
